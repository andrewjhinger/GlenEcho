Write a new React component (or update an existing page) called EventsPage.tsx that displays upcoming community events in a visually appealing and accessible layout. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The page should include the following events with dates, times, sign-up links, and notes where applicable:

Events to include:
July 4th Breakfast & Bike Parade

Date/Time: July 4, 2025, 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM

Bike Parade Lineup: 8:45 AM

Sign-Up Link: tinyurl.com/glen-echo-july-4

Flyer: Add a prominent link labeled “View Flyer” that links to a flyer PDF (assume the file is hosted in the /public/flyers/july4.pdf path for now)

Invasives Removal Event

Date/Time: TBD

Note: “Stay tuned for more information.”

Trash Pickup in Glen Echo Park

Date/Time: TBD

Note: “Details coming soon.”

Sinterclaus/Bootfest

Date/Time: TBD

Note: “Check back later for schedule and sign-up.”

Design requirements:
Each event should be displayed in its own card with a heading, description, date/time, and link(s)

Use responsive design, spacing, and clear typography

Include a top-level page title: Upcoming Events

Place the most immediate event (July 4) at the top

Add a subtle visual indicator (like a colored border or tag) to distinguish confirmed vs. TBD events

File structure assumptions:
Assume Tailwind CSS is installed

Assume the page is located at /app/events/page.tsx in a Next.js 13+ app
